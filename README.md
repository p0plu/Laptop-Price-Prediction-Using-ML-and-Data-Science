# Laptop Price Prediction System

## Overview
The Laptop Price Prediction System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the price of laptops based on various features such as brand, specifications, and performance metrics. This system helps users and businesses make informed decisions when purchasing or pricing laptops.

## Features
- Predict laptop prices based on input features such as brand, RAM, processor, storage, and screen size.
- User-friendly interface for entering laptop specifications.
- Data visualization for understanding trends and insights using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Accurate and interpretable predictions using machine learning models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Modeling**: Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about laptops, including features such as:
- Brand
- Processor Type
- RAM Size
- Storage Capacity
- Screen Size
- Operating System
- Price (target variable)

Ensure the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for training the machine learning model.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data about laptops from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends and correlations between features.
4. **Model Training**: Train and validate machine learning models to predict laptop prices.
5. **Deployment**: Integrate the prediction model into a user-friendly application.
